## Description

AmsterDay is an interactive website built using Express as a foundation, Mongoose for models and database communication. It features multiple models, including one for users, and another model representing the main functionality of the app. The application includes validation on the models with user feedback for invalid submissions. It also offers sign-up, log-in, and log-out functionality with encrypted passwords, along with authorization to grant logged-in users extra capabilities.
